# Retail-Data-Analytics-End-to-End-SQL-Pipeline-Business-Intelligence

📌 Project Overview
This project involves building a robust data pipeline in PostgreSQL to ingest and analyze over 500,000 rows of raw transactional data from a UK-based online retailer. The project demonstrates the full lifecycle of data management, from overcoming complex ingestion hurdles to generating executive-level business insights using advanced SQL techniques like Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and Window Functions.

📊 Business Problem
A growing online retailer needs to move away from spreadsheet-based tracking to a scalable database solution. The goal is to identify high-value customer segments, analyze monthly revenue growth, and pinpoint "hero" products to drive strategic marketing and inventory decisions.

🛠️ Key Challenges & Technical Solutions
Encoding Conflicts: The raw dataset contained regional symbols (like the British Pound £) that caused UTF-8 ingestion failures. I resolved this by identifying and implementing LATIN1 encoding in the COPY command.

Date Formatting Hurdles: The source data used a non-standard DD-MM-YYYY format, which conflicted with PostgreSQL's default MDY expectation. I bypassed this by dynamically setting the session datestyle to DMY.

High-Volume Data Integrity: Successfully managed and cleaned a dataset of 541,910 rows, handling missing customer IDs and negative quantities (returns) programmatically within SQL to ensure 100% reporting accuracy.

📈 Business Outcomes
Identified High-Value "Whales": Discovered that 53.88% of total revenue is generated by a small 'High Value' customer segment, providing a data-backed foundation for targeted retention and loyalty strategies.

Seasonal Growth Forensics: Pinpointed an 84.35% revenue surge during the peak holiday period compared to the monthly average, identifying critical seasonality trends for inventory and staffing optimization.

Technical Resilience: Developed an automated loading script that bypassed standard GUI failures, ensuring 100% data availability for a half-million row database.
